### Hello there üëã, I'm Krupa Panchal.

I am Vadodara *(Gujrat, India)* based Web developer and Software engineer.

I mostly work on React related/based technologies. Basically I love **React**. (half because of Dan and half because of how Ben roasts Angular _**wink**_).
Apart from that I have fairly good grip on backend technologies like Node, Express nad MongoDB.

Currently I am learning **GraphQL**, and getting my-self better at **React-Native**.

If you have any app or project idea (even a Todo app with a twist will work), I'm up to discuss the same.

If you want to reach out to me for any doubts, issues, suggestion - feel free to drop a message. I will try my best to help you out.

üí¨: You can contact me at krupapanchal2527@gmail.com, or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krupa-panchal-80022514b).
     
   I also happen to be on Twitter, Stackoverflow and Reddit (but I am noob over there).
