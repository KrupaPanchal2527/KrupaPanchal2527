### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Krupa Panchal.

I am Vadodara *(Gujrat, India)* based Web developer and Software engineer.

I mostly work on React related/based technologies. Basically I love **React**. (half because of Dan and half because of how Ben roasts Angular _**wink**_).
Apart from that I have fairly good grip on backend technologies like Node, Express nad MongoDB.

Currently I am learning **GraphQL**, and getting my-self better at **React-Native**.

If you have any app or project idea (even a Todo app with a twist will work), I'm down to talk about it.

If you want to reach out to me for any doubts, issues - feel free to drop a message. I will try my best to help you out.

ðŸ’¬: You can contact me at krupapanchal2527@gmail.com, or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krupa-panchal-80022514b).
     
   I also happen to be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/krupa__panchal), Stackoverflow and Reddit (but I am noob over there).  
     
ðŸ”­: Currently I am working on a small **Expense Tracker** project. (Interesting fact is it won't include a database or backend).
Main motive behind not keeping a database and a server is - 
Basically in these days where technology is involved from our day start to day end, some people don't like to put their data out there, let it be anything.
We all want privacy at some point. so this Expense Tracker data will only stay with you. It won't live somewhere in an unknown location, and data getting used elsewhere without you knowing it. And come on, who will want their Expense to be public.
