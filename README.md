### Hello there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Krupa Panchal, A Front-end Developer and a bit of full-stack developer.

I mostly work on React-related technologies for building user-friendly Frontends that keep user interaction and accessibility at the highest. Apart from that I have a fairly good grip on backend technologies like Node, Express and MongoDB.

### A bit about my working style

I am a very organized person in general and the same applies to my work as well. I like to document each and everything while working on a project. (I do this using Notion). Similarly, my code also reflects the same quality of tidiness, organisation and reusability.

### Current Focus

Currently, I am learning **architecting react application on large scale**, and getting myself better at **System Design**.

If you have any app or project idea (even a Todo app with a twist will work), I'm up to discuss the same.

If you want to reach out to me for any doubts, issues, or suggestions - feel free to drop me a message. I will try my best to help you out.
